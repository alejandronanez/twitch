# FCC - Twitch API Project.

### Requirements
- [ ] I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

- [ ] I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

- [ ] If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

- [ ] I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed). You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
